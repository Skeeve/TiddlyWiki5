! Basics

TiddlyWiki5 formats tables using vertical bar characters like so:

```
|!Cell1 |!Cell2 |
|Cell3 |Cell3 |
```

Exclamation marks are used to indicate header cells. The example renders as:

|!Cell1 |!Cell2 |
|Cell3 |Cell3 |

! Cell Alignment

Table cell alignment is controlled by inserting space characters before and/or after the cell content. For example:

```
|Left aligned content |
| Right aligned content|
| Centred content |
|+++ a very wide column so we can see the alignment +++|
```

The example renders as:

|Left aligned content |
| Right aligned content|
| Centred content |
|+++ a very wide column so we can see the alignment +++|

! Cell vertical Alignment

Vertical alignment of cells is done by inserting either a `^` for top alignment or a `,` for bottom alignment as the first character of a cell, followed by a space or as the last character of a cell, preceeded by a space. The normal horizontal alignment is still possible.

A shortned example:

```
|top left ^|^ top center |^ top right|
|middle left | middle center | middle right|
|bottom left ,| bottom center ,|, bottom right|
```

The example renders as:

| :: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | :: |
| ::<br>:: |top left ^|^ top center |^ top right| ::<br>:: |
| ::<br>:: |middle left | middle center | middle right| ::<br>:: |
| ::<br>:: |bottom left ,| bottom center ,|, bottom right| ::<br>:: |
| :: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: | :: |

The reason for the constraint of having to have a space immediately after or before the `^` and `,` is the fact that this will allow us to have these characters still as the first and last character in a cell.

! Cell Merging

To merge a table cell with the one above, use the special cell text `~`. To merge a cell with the one to its left use the text `<`. To merge one to its right use `>`. For example:

```
|Cell1 |Cell2 |Cell3 |Cell4 |
|Cell5 |Cell6 |Cell7 |<|
|Cell5 |~|Cell7 |Cell8 |
|>|Cell9 |Cell10 |Cell11 |
```

Renders as:

|Cell1 |Cell2 |Cell3 |Cell4 |
|Cell5 |Cell6 |Cell7 |<|
|Cell5 |~|Cell7 |Cell8 |
|>|Cell9 |Cell10 |Cell11 |

! Table Classes, Captions, Headers and Footers

Table CSS classes, captions, headers and footers can be specified as special pseudo-rows:

```
|myclass anotherClass|k
|This is a caption |c
|Cell1 |Cell2 |
|Cell3 |Cell3 |
|Header|Header|h
|Footer|Footer|f
```

Renders as:

|myclass anotherClass|k
|This is a caption |c
|Cell1 |Cell2 |
|Cell3 |Cell3 |
|Header|Header|h
|Footer|Footer|f
